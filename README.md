How to train the GPT-2 for Conditional Text Generation
==================================================================

Check out the instructions at 'Documentation for Story Generation Project.pdf'in the repo.

I have created a Colab Notebook for training the GPT-2 model along with instructions for how to encode the training file for keyword-based text generation.

This is part of what I was working on during the second half of my time at the USC Interaction Lab for the USC Robotics and Autonomous Systems REU 2019.

Based on @minimaxir's fantastic work. (Checkout his repo for more details)
